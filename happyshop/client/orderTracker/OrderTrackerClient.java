 * A standalone OrderTracker client that can be run independently without launching the full system.
 * Designed for early-stage testing, though full functionality may require other clients to be active.
 *
 * This client is simple and does not follow the MVC pattern, as it only registers with the OrderHub
 * to receive order status notifications. All logic is handled internally within the OrderTracker.
